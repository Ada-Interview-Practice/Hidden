# Hidden

## Problem Statement
Your goal is to find a hidden message in a data structure.

The data structure will be a ragged matrix, represented by a tuple of tuples of strings. Each string will be a single character, but each inner tuple may have a different length. For example:

```python
matrix_1 = (
    ('u','e','r','e', ' ', 'e'),
    ('d', 'z', 'o', 'b', 'i', 'v'),
    ('n',),
    ('w', 'g', 'q', ' ', '5', 'g', 'w'),
    ('r',),
    ('y', 'e'),
    ('u', 'a', 'u', 't')
)
```

Your function will receive a `matrix` and a positive integer, `n`. The integer `n` represents how frequently to select characters from the matrix.

Your code should iterate over the matrix row-wise and create a string containing every `n`th character from the iteration. For example, with the above matrix, `matrix_1` and an `n` of 2, the first character of the result string should be 'u', then 'r', then ' ', then 'd', and so on.

For this example of `matrix_1` and `n = 2`, the secret message is 'ur doing great'. See the tests in the [`main.py`](main.py) file for more examples.

## Answers to clarifying questions
Q: What should I do if there is invalid input?
A: You can assume the input will be valid.

Q: What should I do if matrix is empty?
A: You can assume the matrix will have at least one string.

Q: Can a string have multiple characters?
A: No.

Q: Does case matter?
A: Yes, 'a' and 'A' should be considered different.

Q: Will there be any empty inner tuples?
A: No.

Q: Can n be less than 1?
A: Also no.

Q: Am I really doing great?
A: Yes ðŸ’œ



## Hints for struggling candidates

 - If your candidate struggles with an initial algorithm, encourage them to walk through an example and desrcibe how they would do it using only pen and paper

 - If your candidate is concerned about the complexity of a double for-loop, encourage them to not worry about the complexity and just focus on a working solution.
